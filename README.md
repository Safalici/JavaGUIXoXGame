# JavaGUIXoXGame
This is an another Java GUI game experience for me, which I made the game of XoX by following a tutorial
But this project still has some bugs:
  Sometimes when the game starts at first step after a player chooses a block it skips the turn of the second player and comes back to first player.
  If it is a draw game doest restarts nor ends meaning game cannot check if all boxes are choosed and I couldn't add a method that can check.
